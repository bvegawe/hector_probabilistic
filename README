calibration/
  Includes code to calibrate the model to observational constraints using an
  adaptive Metropolis Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
  hector_calib_driver.R is the main driving code.
  More info in README_calibration

assessment/
  Read in posterior calibrated parameter sets for probabilistic hindcasts
  and projections.

Functions for calibration of Hector using parallel MCMC chains
Ben Vega-Westhoff
================================================================================

We (currently) read Hector outputs through csvs.
For parallel chains, they each need their own csv file name (so no risk of 
  overwrite), but passing args to
  each chain separately isn't an option in the adaptMCMC package.
  done using the adaptMCMC package.
